(ns hive-mcp.server.hivemind-piggyback-e2e-test
  "End-to-end tests for hivemind shout -> piggyback delivery pipeline.

   Verifies the full path: shout! stores in agent-registry ->
   all-hivemind-messages reads from it -> piggyback/get-messages
   returns them -> routes/wrap-handler-piggybacks appends ---HIVEMIND--- blocks.

   (The old hivemind-only `wrap-handler-piggyback` was merged into the unified
   `wrap-handler-piggybacks` in hive-mcp.server.routes.middleware, which drains
   TOOLRESULT / MEMORY / catchup / HIVEMIND in a single pass. Its HIVEMIND leg
   is exactly what these tests assert on.)

   These tests complement piggyback_middleware_test.clj (which uses
   mock message sources) by testing the real hivemind integration.
