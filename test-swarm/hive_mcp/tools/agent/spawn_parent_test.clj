  "The parent a spawn is attributed to is structural, not remembered.

   Plumbing half of the spawner-addressed piggyback: `:slave/parent` is set
   from the CALLING agent when the `parent` param is absent, so a grandchild's
   shout reaches the ling that spawned it (and not the coordinator) without any
   agent having to pass `parent` by hand. hive-mcp.channel.audience-test covers
   the routing half."
