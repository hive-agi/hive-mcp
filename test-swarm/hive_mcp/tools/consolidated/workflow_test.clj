  "Tests for forge spark's ling-ready poll mechanism.

   Validates that wait-for-ling-ready correctly polls both DataScript
   registration AND CLI readiness before dispatching.

   Two-phase readiness:
     Phase 1: DataScript slave entry exists (usually instant after spawn!)
     Phase 2: CLI ready — mode-specific (vterm prompt marker, headless stdout)

   Since commit 508a7e8 the readiness module also:
     - picks the timeout per spawn-mode (`timeout-ms-for-spawn-mode`):
       vterm/claude -> `vterm-ling-ready-timeout-ms`,
       everything else -> config `[:services :forge :readiness-timeout-ms]`
       falling back to `default-ling-ready-timeout-ms`;
     - retries the whole poll ONCE after `readiness-retry-wait-ms` on timeout,
       reporting the CUMULATIVE elapsed-ms across both windows.
   The old single knob `ling-ready-timeout-ms` no longer exists — tests below
   drive `vterm-ling-ready-timeout-ms` (all poll tests use :claude mode).

   CLARITY: T - Telemetry (test) validates behavioral correctness."
