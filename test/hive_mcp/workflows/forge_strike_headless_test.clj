(ns hive-mcp.workflows.forge-strike-headless-test
  "Integration tests for forge-strike with headless spawn_mode.

   Validates the full smite→survey→spark cycle when spawn_mode is :headless.
   Since 0.12.0: 'forge strike' is FSM-driven by default.
   The imperative path is deprecated (handle-forge-strike-imperative).

   Test strategy:
   1. FSM layer (pure) — mock resources with :spawn-mode :headless in config
   2. Default workflow (FSM) — verify handle-forge-strike uses FSM path
   3. Deprecated imperative — verify handle-forge-strike-imperative still works
   4. Edge cases — quench, no-tasks, slot-limiting (via imperative for internal coverage)
   5. End-to-end with real subprocess — use `echo` command as safe headless process

   All tests use isolated DataScript connections to avoid cross-contamination.

   CLARITY: T — Telemetry validates forge-strike correctness with headless mode."
