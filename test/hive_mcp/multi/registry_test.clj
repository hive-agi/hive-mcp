  "Property + unit tests for the multi.registry façade and its four child
   registries.

   Coverage:
     - register! conflict policy (ok / replaced / conflict)
     - deregister-by-owner! ownership isolation
     - resolve-tool-handler chain (registry → flat fallback)
     - lookup-batchable-or-default LSP fallback
     - snapshot version stability across no-op operations
