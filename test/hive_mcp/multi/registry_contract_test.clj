(ns hive-mcp.multi.registry-contract-test
  "Cross-impl contract suite for every tool registered in `multi.registry`.

   Walks `r-tools/all-names` (the live registry surface) and asserts:
   1. Every entry has a callable handler resolvable via
      `multi-registry/resolve-tool-handler`.
   2. Every entry's `command=help` response is shape-compliant — either
      a `{:type \"text\" :text ...}` MCP success or a `:isError`-flagged
      MCP error (per `tools.core/mcp-error` shape). NEVER throws.
   3. Every entry resolves to a `Batchable` via
      `multi-registry/lookup-batchable-or-default` (LSP guarantee — the
      `DefaultBatchableAdapter` substitutes for tools without an
      explicit record).
   4. Running an empty op-set through `Batchable/batch-execute` returns
      the canonical `{:success :waves :summary}` shape (Batchable
      contract clause 1). Confirms ALL tools satisfy the same shape
      regardless of which path they take, catching the kind of read-path
      drift that produced the qdrant `get-entry` decoder bug one layer
      below.

   The suite exists explicitly to catch new-tool drift: any addon that
   registers a tool but breaks one of the above auto-fails here.

   Decision: 20260429230453-7e7627cc (capabilities-as-protocols, SOLID
   for consolidated MCP tools). Plan: sketch-bigger-root-problem-optimized-spring."
