  "Tests for backward-compatibility deprecation shims.

   Test Coverage:
   1. make-shim - Factory function creates working shims
   2. Deprecation warnings - Shims emit DEPRECATED log messages
   3. Parameter renaming - Old param names translated to new ones
   4. Static params - Shims merge static params into calls
   5. Metadata - Shims carry deprecation metadata
   6. Utility functions - deprecated?, sunset-date, migration-info
   7. Shim registry - All shims defined and registered
   8. Tool definitions - MCP tool defs have correct structure"
