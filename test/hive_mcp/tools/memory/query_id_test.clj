  "MEM-P2-METADATA-BUG regression tests.

   Two defects, pinned here:

   (A) `memory metadata id=X` was a thin alias onto :memory/query. handle-query's
       closed destructuring drops :id, so the call degraded into an unfiltered,
       type-less in-scope scan that returned ~20 arbitrary entries — the requested
       id nowhere among them, and no error raised.

   (B) The same nil-type hole reachable without :id: a FULLY unconstrained
       `memory query` (no type, no tags, no exclude_tags, no scope, no duration)
       silently returned an arbitrary in-scope slice instead of failing loudly.

   Strategy: handler-level, with-redefs over the IMemoryStore protocol vars —
   no live Milvus/Chroma required."
