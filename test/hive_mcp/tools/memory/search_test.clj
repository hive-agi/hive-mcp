  "Defensive timeout tests for memory search (task 20260404125344-0365f8a8).

   Pins the per-stage timeout guarantees:
   - Slow embedding (stub via slow store that blocks inside search-similar
     with an 'embedding' message) → structured err within budget + slack.
   - Slow vectordb (stub store that blocks forever) → structured err.
   - Throwing vectordb → structured err.
   - Happy path → same :ok result shape as before the refactor.

   Stubs work at the protocol boundary: we register a mock IMemoryStore
   via mem-proto/register-store! and inject behaviour in the defrecord's
   search-similar. Each test sets a unique :default store and restores
   any pre-existing default in a fixture-free try/finally pattern to
   stay thread-safe across the suite."
