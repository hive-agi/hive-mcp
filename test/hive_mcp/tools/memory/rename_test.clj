(ns hive-mcp.tools.memory.rename-test
  "Tests for handle-rename-project unified rename command.

   Coverage:
   - Validation: missing params, same old/new
   - Dry-run: returns preview without modifying
   - Full rename: orchestrates the memory store + KG + EDN + config
   - EDN update: appends old-project-id to :aliases, idempotent
   - Config re-registration: kg-scope gets updated
   - Error handling: graceful on store/KG failures

   Entries and edges are seeded through the ports and asserted through the
   ports; no backend is named."
