  "Tests for `kg cleanup-synthetics` — prunes or demotes synthetic-pattern
   nodes whose outgoing edges mostly target missing/expired memory entries.

   Fabrication pattern:
     1. DataScript KG fixture (fresh per test).
     2. Stub memory store whose `get-entry` returns non-nil for a
        configurable set of 'live' IDs — missing IDs simulate expired
        raw entries.
     3. Register :projects-to relation (synthetic nodes use it) and
        create synth- prefixed edges.
     4. Assert cleanup behavior under varying thresholds/actions."
