(ns hive-mcp.tools.kg.commands-test
  "Boundary-flush (read-your-writes) regression tests for KG mutation handlers.

   KG writes default to the async write-coalescing queue (edges/add-edge! ->
   conn/transact!), which returns the client-side edge-id BEFORE the datom is
   durable. `with-kg-flush` wraps the mutation handlers so the queue is drained
   (conn/flush-pending!) before the tool call returns — i.e. a read issued
   immediately after the handler (such as the next op in a multi/k> batch that
   traverses the just-created edge) sees the edge instead of racing the ~25ms
   coalescing window.

   These tests run in DEFAULT async mode (no *sync-writes* binding) so the
   boundary flush is the only thing making the write durable on return — remove
   it and `immediate-read` goes empty (verified: a raw, unwrapped handler leaves
   the edge invisible until a manual flush). Kanban 20260629161156-76f4e486."

  "Per-test isolated KG store with auto setup + teardown.

   Delegates to the disposable test-store harness: a fresh in-memory DataScript
   store installed as the GLOBAL store (not a thread-local *test-store*) so the

   Deliberately async (no *sync-writes*): these tests must exercise the
   coalescing path so the handler's boundary flush provides read-your-writes.
