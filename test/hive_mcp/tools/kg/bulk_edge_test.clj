  "batch-edge must cost ONE transaction and ONE flush, not N of each.

   The generic batch runner dispatched every op to handle-kg-add-edge, which is
   with-kg-flush(add-edge*): one datahike transaction AND one flush-pending!
   barrier per edge. Measured 2026-08-29 during corpus synthesis, where a single
   book issues thousands of edges and the coordinator logged a continuous
   kg_add_edge stream plus repeated `flush-pending! deadline exceeded`."
