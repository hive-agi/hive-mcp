(ns hive-mcp.tools.agent.spawn-guard-test
  "Tests for spawn handler defense-in-depth guard.

   Verifies that child lings (HIVE_MCP_ROLE=child-ling) cannot spawn
   agents, preventing recursive self-call chains.

   Test Coverage:
   1. Guard denies spawn for child lings
   2. Guard allows spawn for coordinator (normal path)
   3. Error message includes role, depth, and guidance
   4. Guard works with batch-spawn routing
   5. Guard logs violation with correct metadata"
