  "Per-call timeout for the Emacs-backed git tools.

   The client already accepted a timeout and already clamped it; what was
   missing was any way for a CALLER to ask. Three properties:

   1. Omitting `timeout_ms` routes through the untimed seam, so the client's
      own default still applies and nothing about existing calls changes.
   2. Passing it routes through the timed seam and the value arrives VERBATIM.
      It is deliberately not clamped here — `hive-emacs.client` is the last
      line of defense, and a second ceiling would be a second place the limit
      lives.
   3. EVERY git command honours it. A handler added later without threading
      the parameter is the regression this suite exists to catch, so the test
      enumerates the tool's own command map rather than a hand-kept list."
