  "End-to-end test for KG edge creation via crystallize workflow.

   Tests the full flow:
   1. Create source entries in Chroma (simulating session notes/tasks)
   2. Call crystallize with harvested data containing source IDs
   3. Verify :derived-from edges exist in KG

   Unlike crystal-kg-test which uses mocked functions, this test
   exercises the real Chroma and KG components end-to-end."
