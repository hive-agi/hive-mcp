  "End-to-end integration tests for the Multi DSL pipeline.

   Tests cover 4 areas + edge cases:
   1. DSL → Batch → Results (verb parsing, param aliases, execution, $ref threading)
   2. Macro → DSL → Batch (macro expansion, parameterized macros, nesting)
   3. Async Pipeline (dispatch, collect, cancel, concurrency)
   4. Error Handling (unknown verbs, invalid $refs, bad batch-ids, mutual exclusion)
   5. Verb Table Coverage (contract tests for all 30 verbs)
   6. Full Pipeline + Edge Cases

   Modules under development (dsl/verbs, multi async) are resolved dynamically
   via requiring-resolve. Tests skip gracefully when target modules are not yet
   available. Tool handlers are mocked via with-redefs for isolation.
