  "Pinning tests for drone diff workflow tools.

   Tests verify:
   - propose_diff stores diffs in pending atom
   - list_proposed_diffs returns all pending diffs
   - apply_diff applies changes and removes from pending
   - reject_diff discards without applying
   - Path resolution uses correct project root (BUG FIX)

   Uses with-redefs to mock file operations for isolated unit testing."
