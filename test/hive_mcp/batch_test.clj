;;
;; 1. Dangling KG edges when a source `m+` produced `:id nil`. Dependent k>
;;    ran with `$ref:src.id` resolving to nil and silently created edges
;;    against null endpoints.
;; 2. Off-by-one in batch summary count when a worker timed out and
;;    returned nil — the wave aggregator collapsed all nil-id results
;;    under one entry, dropping ops from `:total`.
;; 3. (Out of scope here) `b+` not idempotent on retry — needs server-side
;;    idempotency-key plumbing in the kanban facade. Deferred.
