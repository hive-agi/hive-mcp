  "Tests for the DAGWave scheduler.
   
   Tests the core scheduling logic with mocked dependencies:
   - Kanban reached through the kanban ports: a table-backed
     IKanbanRead/IKanbanWrite double is installed in the registry
   - KG edge queries mocked via with-redefs
   - Ling spawning mocked (no actual processes)
   - Channel subscription mocked (no pub/sub)
   
   Test categories:
   1. find-ready-tasks (pure logic)
   2. dispatch-wave! (stateful but mocked)
   3. on-ling-complete (event handler)
   4. start-dag!/stop-dag! (lifecycle)
   5. dag-status (query)
   6. Edge cases (cycles, failures, dry-run)"
