  "Regression tests for dual-path dedup in merged-messages.

   Root cause (kanban 54741a74): when NATS backbone is connected, shout!
   writes to both the atom (message-source-fn path) AND publishes to NATS
   (backbone-buffer path). JSON roundtrip converts keyword event-types to
   strings, so the old dedup key [agent-id timestamp :progress] didn't
   match [agent-id timestamp \"progress\"] — producing duplicates.

   Fix: stable :shout-id (UUID) at emit time enables cross-path dedup
   regardless of keyword/string mismatch."
