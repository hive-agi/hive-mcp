  "GOLDEN RECALL — CASE 1: LEXICAL ANCHOR.

   'A query containing a rare literal token present in a known entry must
    retrieve it.'

   This is THE case that failed on 2026-07-12. The query
   'SIGSEGV crash JDK 25 bug use Java 21' names four rare literal tokens that
   occur together in exactly one entry (20260511194834-344a3bc0), and `memory
   search` did not return it — while still returning eight confident rows with
   plausible distances.

   Driven through the REAL MCP entry point, `tools.memory.search/handle-search-
   semantic`, so the whole production path is under test: the `limit * 2`
   overfetch in `run-store-query`, the normalization in `store-entry->normalized`,
   the ASCENDING sort + `take limit` in `chroma.search/merge-and-rerank`, and
   the JSON envelope. The only thing stubbed is the network: the store is
   `recall.golden/->golden-store`, which does real cosine over a real corpus
   with a deterministic bag-of-words embedder.

   THE CANARY HAS TEETH. `canary-fires-on-the-inverted-ranking-unit` runs the
   identical pipeline against a store whose only defect is the one
   MEM-P0-EMBED-LANE fixed — a COSINE *similarity* handed across the boundary
   under the `:distance` key — and asserts the suite goes RED. A green canary
   that cannot be made to fail is a lie, and a lie is what we are here to
   remove."
