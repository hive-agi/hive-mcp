(ns hive-mcp.tools-duration-test
  "Unit tests for MCP duration management tool handlers.

   Tests cover the following handlers:
   - handle-mcp-memory-set-duration: Set duration category for entry
   - handle-mcp-memory-promote: Promote entry to longer duration
   - handle-mcp-memory-demote: Demote entry to shorter duration
   - handle-mcp-memory-cleanup-expired: Remove expired entries
   - handle-mcp-memory-expiring-soon: List entries expiring within N days
   - handle-mcp-memory-add: Updated with duration param
   - handle-mcp-memory-query: Updated with duration filter

   All tests verify proper MCP response format {:type \"text\" :text ...}
   and Chroma-based error handling.
   
   UPDATED: Tests now mock Chroma functions instead of emacsclient,
   reflecting the Chroma-only storage architecture."
