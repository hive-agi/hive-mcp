  "TDD tests for hivemind <-> swarm state synchronization.

   Problem: When a ling calls `hivemind_shout :completed`, the `swarm_status`
   should show that slave as 'idle', not 'working'. Currently these are
   disconnected state stores.

   CLARITY: Telemetry first - verify state flows correctly between systems.
   DDD: Testing the domain invariant that agent state is consistent."
