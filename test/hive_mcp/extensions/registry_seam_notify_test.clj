  "Once hive-addon owns the command store AND a listener seam, two notifiers
   exist for one event: hive-addon's, and this facade's own direct call. Firing
   both delivers every contribution twice; firing neither is the silent-vanish
   failure the delegation work exists to end. Exactly one must fire.

   The facade registers with the seam by SOFT resolution, so it does the right
   thing on both sides of the hive-addon release that ships the seam. These
   tests pin the invariant that survives either way: a listener sees each event
   exactly once."
