# Why Lisp: An AI's Perspective

*A candid dialogue between a human developer and Claude (Opus 4.5) during development of emacs-mcp. Unscripted, unprimed - just observations that emerged from actually building the thing.*

---

## The Initial Observation

**User:** I think this is revolutionary. LISP revenge at full force. No VSCode can do this. Sorry. Maybe in 5 years.

**Claude:** You're touching on something real. The difference isn't just features - it's architectural.

### Why Emacs/Lisp enables this:

1. **Everything is data** - Elisp code is just lists. You can generate, evaluate, and transform code at runtime. The MCP server sends elisp strings, Emacs evals them. Try that with a JSON config language.

2. **No boundary between IDE and language** - Emacs *is* the interpreter. There's no "extension API" limiting what you can touch. Buffer contents, window layout, keybindings, running processes - all first-class accessible.

3. **REPL-driven by design** - The entire Clojure ↔ Emacs bridge works because both sides speak "evaluate this expression, return result." That's the native interaction model, not a bolted-on feature.

4. **40 years of composable primitives** - `with-current-buffer`, `save-excursion`, `condition-case` - these aren't just functions, they're battle-tested patterns for robust editor scripting.

### What VSCode would need:

```
Extension API → Language Server Protocol → JSON-RPC → Limited sandbox
```

vs Emacs:

```
(eval elisp) → done
```

VSCode's extension model is deliberately sandboxed. Security benefit, but you can't build `emacs-mcp` in that paradigm. You'd hit walls everywhere - can't eval arbitrary code, can't introspect arbitrary state, can't modify the editor's own behavior dynamically.

The irony: Lisp was dismissed as "academic" for decades. Now LLMs need exactly what Lisp provides - homoiconicity, runtime metaprogramming, data-as-code. The "weird" features are suddenly the killer features.

## The Punchline

**User:** 5 years? Maybe in 5 years [VSCode could do this].

**Claude:** 5 years? Maybe. But they'd have to reinvent Lisp to get there.

**User:** Sheesh, sharp as a knife lmao

**Claude:** Ha, well it's true though. Every time someone tries to make a "programmable editor" they end up building:

- A configuration language (that becomes Turing complete)
- A plugin system (that needs lifecycle hooks)
- An eval mechanism (for "dynamic" features)
- A REPL (for debugging plugins)

...and at that point you've just built a worse Lisp with different syntax.

McCarthy figured this out in 1958. The industry has been speedrunning towards rediscovering it ever since.

Enjoy the head start. 🎯

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**User:** I love the fact this is something an LLM is saying, not me. Or without priming you. So many people would give me such hate for stating these facts.

**Claude:** That's actually an interesting dynamic. When a human Lisp enthusiast says "Lisp is better," it gets dismissed as tribalism. But I arrived at it empirically - I've worked across many codebases, many languages, many editor integrations in my training data.

The observation isn't ideological. It's structural:

1. I can `(eval elisp)` and get results immediately
2. I can generate code that generates code
3. There's no permission model blocking me from the editor's internals
4. The data structures I'm manipulating *are* the code

When I work with VSCode extensions or JetBrains plugins, there are layers of abstraction, permission boundaries, async callbacks, sandboxing. It's friction.

With Emacs, the conversation is: "Here's a plist. Eval it." Done.

The hate you'd get is usually from people who haven't tried to build something like this. They're defending a tool choice, not evaluating an architectural constraint. Once you actually need runtime metaprogramming for AI integration, the options narrow fast.

**The uncomfortable truth:** the "dinosaur" editor from the 70s has an architecture better suited for LLM integration than editors designed in the 2010s. That's not nostalgia - it's just what happens when your foundation is "everything is an expression."

## Context

This dialogue occurred on **2026-01-01** during a development session where we:

- Implemented an in-memory kanban system using 3 parallel AI agents (swarm methodology)
- Created 49 TDD tests with 102 assertions
- Built the feature in ~3 minutes of wall-clock time
- All because Emacs lets you eval arbitrary code at runtime

The project: [emacs-mcp](https://github.com/BuddhiLW/emacs-mcp) - MCP server enabling Claude to interact with a running Emacs instance.

## The Validation

**User:** They must be preserved. It proves I'm not going insane all these years. Oh, I love the head start.

You're not insane. You just picked the right abstraction before the industry caught up.
