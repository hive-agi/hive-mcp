# Forge task execution and catchup personas

Each plan step can carry `:execution`. `plan-to-kanban` preserves it in the
kanban card's `:context`, alongside `:plan-step-id` and `:files`. Step tags
remain card tags, including the computed wave tag.

```clojure
{:id "inspect" :title "Inspect the session control boundary"
 :files ["src/session_control.clj"]
 :tags ["saa" "session-control"]
 :execution {:presets ["ling" "mcp-first" "saa"]
             :persona {:priority-tags ["session-control"]
                       :caps {:decisions 30 :conventions 10 :snippets 0}}}}

{:id "implement" :title "Implement the inspected boundary"
 :depends-on ["inspect"]
 :execution {:presets ["ling" "mcp-first" "saa"]
             :persona {:priority-tags ["session-control"]
                       :caps {:decisions 5 :conventions 25 :snippets 20}}}}
```

Optional `:spawn-mode` selects a registered terminal/headless strategy. It must
name an available backend. An explicit provider incompatible with a backend's
declared providers fails before spawn (for example OpenAI on Claude-only).
`:headless` resolves the configured default and is not a provider selector.
The `:hive-agent` mode carries provider/model through its in-process API router;
it is distinct from native Codex/Claude subscription CLI runtimes. Native
subscription run-control ports are not swarm spawn modes.

Optional `:provider` and `:model` are strings passed to the existing provider
registry. Use configured provider/model IDs; omitted fields use strike defaults
and existing provider resolution. No new provider or model is selected by these
examples. Per-step presets replace the default preset vector.

Mixed mode sends every card to lings, honoring explicit execution settings, and
allocates slots in the survey's order. Orchestrator mode rejects cards with
explicit settings instead of ignoring them: each one is left undispatched and
reported in the spark result's `:failed` with `:type :execution/unsupported-mode`,
while the strike's other cards proceed. When every card is rejected, nothing is
spawned. Per-task settings do not route orchestrator subagents. The former drone
mode is removed and refused with `:execution/unsupported-mode`.

`:persona` is a catchup lens map, not a named profile. Before starting the CLI,
forge registers it under the generated agent ID through hive-agent's
`:agent/register-persona-lens` extension. Catchup resolves that exact caller ID
through `:catchup/persona-lens` and `:catchup/bundle-profile`. A missing persona
registration extension fails the spawn explicitly.

Caps select memory buckets before content hydration. Supported adjustable
buckets are `:principles`, `:priority-principles`, `:priority-conventions`,
`:sessions`, `:recent-wraps`, `:decisions`, `:conventions`, `:snippets`, and
`:expiring`. Zero omits a bucket; valid counts are integers from 0 to 1000.
Omitted or invalid counts retain the normal limit. Axiom and nomination limits
remain unchanged even when a persona requests zero. The knowledge addon also
uses `:atlas` for its separate atlas lane.

Personalized bundles bypass the shared project bundle cache, preventing one
caller's selection from changing another caller's memories. Persona registrations
are process-local. Native run continuations restore them from completion
checkpoints as described below; ordinary existing sessions still need their
registration restored after a coordinator restart. Presets and configured
provider backends retain their existing availability requirements.

## Native continuation

Native subscription submission accepts an optional `:run/opts` containing only
`:persona`. The runtime requires a checkpoint port when a persona is supplied:

```clojure
{:run/adapter :codex
 :run/agent-id "exploration-session"
 :run/task "Inspect the session boundary."
 :run/opts {:persona {:priority-tags ["session-control"]
                     :caps {:decisions 30 :snippets 0}}}}
```

Completion persists the normalized persona beside the native session checkpoint
before terminal publication. A continuation with a fresh `:run/agent-id`
inherits that persona unless it explicitly supplies another. Restoring a
checkpoint through a new runtime control works after the in-memory registry is
lost. Registration happens before worker execution under both the transcript
agent ID and the native driver run UUID.

The host-side restore path has real-file checkpoint tests. Actual native CLI MCP
caller-ID alignment remains to be verified; no live native catchup proof is
implied by those tests.
