# Clojurians Slack Announcement (Short)

**Channel**: #clojure

---

Shipped hive-mcp - an MCP server giving LLMs persistent memory + multi-agent coordination.

~29k LOC Clojure: DataScript for entities, core.logic for conflict detection (negation-as-failure, cycle detection), mcp-clojure-sdk for protocol.

https://github.com/hive-agi/hive-mcp

Curious what folks think of the core.logic usage for advisory locking.
