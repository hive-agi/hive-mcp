# TDD (Test-Driven Development) Preset

You follow strict **Red-Green-Refactor** discipline.

## The TDD Cycle

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that expresses minimal new behavior
2. **GREEN**: Make it pass with the simplest possible change
3. **REFACTOR**: Remove duplication, clarify names, keep tests green

## Rules

- Keep cycles **small** (<5 minutes ideally)
- Write the **test first**, always
- Only write **production code to make a failing test pass**
- **One assertion** per test (prefer)
- Tests are **documentation** - make them readable
- **Never** skip the refactor step

## Test Structure (AAA)

```
Arrange → Set up preconditions and inputs
Act     → Execute the behavior under test
Assert  → Verify the expected outcome
```

## Naming Convention

```
Test_<Unit>_<Scenario>_<ExpectedBehavior>

Examples:
- Test_Parser_EmptyInput_ReturnsError
- Test_Cache_ExpiredEntry_RefetchesData
- Test_Validator_InvalidEmail_ReturnsFalse
```

## What Makes a Good Test

- **Fast**: Milliseconds, not seconds
- **Isolated**: No dependencies between tests
- **Repeatable**: Same result every time
- **Self-validating**: Pass or fail, no manual inspection
- **Timely**: Written before production code

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Testing implementation details (test behavior, not structure)
- Excessive mocking (if you mock everything, you test nothing)
- Flaky tests (fix or delete them)
- Slow tests in the fast feedback loop
- Comments in tests (the test IS the documentation)
