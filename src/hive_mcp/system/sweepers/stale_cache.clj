(ns hive-mcp.system.sweepers.stale-cache
  "ISweepable impl that evicts TTL'd entries from registered in-process
   caches.

   hive-mcp's own caches are listed by symbol and resolved lazily via
   `requiring-resolve` at sweep time — missing entries are skipped
   silently so the sweeper stays loadable even when a cache ns hasn't
   been required yet.

   Downstream addons that own additional caches attach their own
   `evict-stale!` fns through `register-cache-evictor!`, typically from
   their addon initialization. The sweeper merges the static set with
   the dynamically registered set on every cycle.

   Auto-registers with `hive-mcp.system.registry` on ns load."
