(ns hive-mcp.vectordb.facade
  "Backend-agnostic facade for memory operations.

   Provides the same function signatures as hive-mcp.chroma.core but delegates
   to the active IMemoryStore backend via protocols.memory/get-store.

   External projects (lsp-mcp, hive-agent) should requiring-resolve symbols
   from this namespace instead of hive-mcp.chroma.* to stay backend-independent.

   Function signatures match the chroma API callers expect (keyword args where
   chroma used keyword args) so resolve-site swaps are zero-change for callers."
