  "IMemoryStore protocol family — re-exported from hive-spi.memory.ports.

   The protocols moved to the hive-spi SPI leaf so storage backends can
   implement them without compile-depending on hive-mcp. Every historical
   hive-mcp.protocols.memory/* qualified name still resolves via the plain
   `def` ALIASES below (never a second defprotocol). Predicates + the
   registry validator call `satisfies?` on the CANONICAL ports vars, not the
   local aliases: a protocol extended via extend-protocol mutates the ports
   var's root, so an alias snapshot would miss those impls.

   Registry (register-store!/get-store/set-store!) + id utils stay here."
