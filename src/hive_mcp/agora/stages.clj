  "Two-Stage Agora: staged debate orchestration.

   Stage 1 (:research) - Research drones gather evidence in parallel.
                          Each drone investigates one focus area and
                          outputs structured evidence JSON.
                          Stage ends when all research drones signal :no-change.

   Stage 2 (:debate)   - Debate drones argue positions with Stage 1
                          evidence injected into their context.
                          Standard Nash equilibrium consensus applies.

   Event flow:
   :agora/debate-started -> Stage 1 research drones dispatched
   :agora/turn-completed (all research done) -> :agora/stage-transition
   :agora/stage-transition -> Collect evidence, spawn Stage 2 participants
   Stage 2 runs via normal event chain until consensus/timeout.

   SOLID-S: Single responsibility - stage transitions only.
   CLARITY-L: Layer separation from debate.clj execution."
