(ns hive-mcp.resilience.store
  "Handler-side reactive resilience around memory-store calls.

   Kernel code: every name it touches is a port (`protocols.memory`,
   `protocols.memory-liveness`) or a kernel resilience namespace, so it
   belongs to the kernel and not to the vectordb slice.
   `hive-mcp.vectordb.resilience` is a call-through facade over this
   namespace and dies with the hive-memory extraction.

   Cross-store seam: dispatches reconnect logic through
   `hive-mcp.protocols.memory/IMemoryStoreLiveness` so this layer never
   imports any vendor-specific namespace. Every store that owns a
   transport which can drop mid-flight (HTTP/gRPC pools, k8s pod
   restarts, NAT idle-timeout) extends the protocol; this layer
   orchestrates kick + await + retry without knowing which store it is
   talking to.

   Failure classification is the closed `ErrorClass` ADT in
   `hive-mcp.resilience.protocol`. Three branches:

   - `:err/schema-mismatch`  — terminate with `:embedder/dim-mismatch`
                                ex-info. No retry, no heal, no log
                                spam. Emits an advisory hive-event
                                (`:resilience/dim-mismatch`) so future
                                observers (metrics, KG) can react
                                without coupling to this layer.
   - `:err/transient`        — kick the heal loop, await recovery,
                                retry `f` once. Same single-retry
                                semantics as before the fix.
   - everything else         — propagate the original throwable.

   Internals use the `hive-dsl` Result railway (`ok` / `err` /
   `let-ok`). The legacy `call-with-resilience` keeps its
   exception-throwing surface for backward compatibility with the
   ~50 existing call sites; new code that wants Result semantics
   should call `call-with-resilience-result` directly."
