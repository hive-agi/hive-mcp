(ns hive-mcp.scripts.kg-datahike-rebuild
  "One-off rebuild of the KG datahike store, keeping only durable edges.

   Carto structural edges (both endpoints a UUID) live in the :carto datalevin
   slot and are regenerable by `carto scan`; carto reads already come
   from :carto. They are dropped here. Retraction is infeasible in-heap
   (see memory 20260521153840-1e8a1b05), so we export the keep-set and
   import it into a fresh store.

   Run order (deliberate):
     1. (export-keep-edges! \"/tmp/kg-keep.edn\")   ; against the current store
     2. stop hive-mcp
     3. mv ~/.local/share/hive-mcp/datahike ~/.local/share/hive-mcp/datahike.bloated-bak
     4. start hive-mcp                              ; fresh empty datahike auto-created
     5. (import-keep-edges! \"/tmp/kg-keep.edn\")
     6. (verify)                                    ; snapshot count + carto smoke"
