(ns hive-mcp.channel.activation
  "Activation seam for the memory piggyback drain.

   `drain-ctx` builds the ctx that `memory-piggyback/drain!` hands to the
   ranker. Without a registered provider it is exactly `{:tokens <cues>}` —
   today's behaviour byte for byte. With one, the provider's `:pins` and
   `:floor-cap` are merged in and its `:tokens` are unioned onto the cues.

   DIP: this ns knows only the extension KEY and the shape of the answer. It
   never learns what a rule is, how eligibility is decided, or that core.logic
   exists — that lives behind `:memory/activation` (see
   `hive-knowledge.activation.addon`).

   Total: a provider that throws, hangs on a bad shape, or returns garbage
   degrades to the plain cue ctx. Activation must never be able to break a tool
   response."

   Deliberately NOT a place to add response content. An activation provider
   steers the memory DRAIN, and that is all this key means. Anything an addon
   wants to SAY in the response is a block emitter registered under `:block/*`
   and rendered by `hive-mcp.channel.blocks`, so the host never learns the name
   of what it is rendering."
