(defn drain!
  "Drain next batch of entries within char budget for a caller session.

   Carries :context-refs forward across batches and attaches them to the first
   response after they are enqueued, marking them delivered.

   On exhaustion the buffer collapses to a content-free tombstone retaining the
   delivered ids under :sent, so a later enqueue! for the same caller can skip
   what this session already received.

   The 2-arity takes a drain ctx. A non-empty (:tokens ctx) selects the batch
   two-lane via drain-rank/select-batch, rewrites the undrained tail of the
   buffer into that order, and ages every offered-but-not-taken entry under
   :offers. ctx :pins and :floor-cap are forwarded to the ranker. ctx nil, or
   ctx without :tokens, is FIFO — identical to the 1-arity in both the returned
   batch and the buffer written back.

   The WIRE POLICY is resolved first and applied to the whole buffer, so the
   char budget is spent on what is actually sent. Under :index every pool entry
   becomes an id-and-title pointer while floor entries (axioms, pins) pass
   through whole; the projection is idempotent, so writing a projected buffer
   back is safe. ctx :policy overrides the configured one. When the batch
   carries pointers the result gains :pull, the instruction for turning them
   back into entries.

   Every drain folds its offered / delivered ids into `drain-telemetry`."
