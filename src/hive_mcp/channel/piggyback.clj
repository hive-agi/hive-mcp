(defn get-messages
  "Get new hivemind messages since last call for this agent+project.
   Dual-path: merges messages from atom-based source and backbone buffer.

   Five stages, in order: cursor -> project -> context -> audience -> digest.

   CURSOR is per [reader project], with one exception that is the whole
   point: a \"global\" shout is read against ONE cursor per SESSION, whatever
   project the read asked for. Every project-scoped read accepts global
   shouts, so with a cursor per project each first read under a new
   project-id (a git call against another repo, a kanban call for a sibling)
   replayed the entire global history from timestamp 0: the repeating-shouts
   symptom of kanban 20260519145332-0c5878a5, measured again 2026-09-07 when
   two commits in two repos each redelivered 54 wave shouts, and again
   2026-09-14 when one window re-read 30 wave shouts once per repo it
   touched. The reader id the MCP lane derives already carries the project
   (\"coordinator:7-hive\"), so the global cursor is keyed by :session-id,
   the caller without its project, when the caller supplies one; a caller
   that does not is keyed by its reader id as before.

   CONTEXT scopes a read to ONE A2A conversation (`:context-id`). It is opt-in:
   without it every conversation is read, exactly as before. Cursors advance
   over what the CONTEXT filter accepted, never over what it excluded —
   otherwise a read scoped to one conversation would silently consume the
   messages of every other one.

   AUDIENCE is what keeps one ling's turns out of every other ling's context.
   A message that names a recipient (`:to`) reaches THAT agent and nobody
   else; absent one, it reaches the agent that spawned its author (see
   hive-mcp.channel.audience). Set config [:hivemind :piggyback-routing] to
   :project to restore the legacy project-wide broadcast.

   Directed peer traffic never enters a coordinator's context — that omission
   is the saving directed addressing exists for. So a coordinator reader also
   gets `peer-traffic-digest` rows: one line per conversation saying how many
   turns passed between whom, and the contextId to read them by. It keeps
   supervision without paying for the transcript.

   DIGEST collapses a burst of per-turn :progress rows from one agent into a
   single row carrying the count, so the reader learns the state without
   reading the transcript. A row the agent shouted DELIBERATELY (through the
   hivemind tool, carried as :deliberate?) is never collapsed: measured
   2026-09-07, a wave member's own `hivemind shout` was folded into the
   runtime's `bb-ling turn 2` telemetry row and the reader never saw what the
   member said. Disable digesting entirely via [:hivemind :progress-digest] false.

   Options:
     :project-id              - Primary project scope for filtering
     :additional-project-ids  - Set of extra project-ids to include (for cross-project
                                descendant shouts). Messages from these projects are
                                included alongside the primary project's messages.
     :session-id              - The caller id without its project suffix; owns the
                                global cursor. Defaults to the reader id.
