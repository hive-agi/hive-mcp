(ns hive-mcp.nats.client
  "NATS client wrapper for push-based agent notifications, enabling real-time
   communication in the Hive system. Manages connection lifecycle, publish,
   subscribe, and health checks.

   Implements a graceful degradation model: when NATS is unavailable, the system
   automatically falls back to polling-based collect mechanisms, ensuring
   reliability without fatal errors.

   Depends on the Java NATS client (io.nats.client) for low-level NATS protocol
   handling. State is managed via atoms: connection (io.nats.client.Connection),
   dispatcher (async message handling), and subscriptions (subject-to-Subscription
   tracking for cleanup)."
