  "Universal event backbone bridge — routes hive events through IEventBackbone.

   Subject hierarchy (v1):
     hive.v1.shout.{project}.{agent-id}          : hivemind shouts
     hive.v1.event.{type}                         : system events
     hive.v1.tool.{tool-name}                     : tool notifications
     hive.v1.agent.{completed|failed}.{ling-id}  : headless ling lifecycle
     hive.v1.wave.{run-id}.completed.{task-id}   : wave-scoped ling completion

   Publisher side: called from shout!, effect handlers, headless ling adapters.
   Subscriber side: delegates fanout to IDeliveryChannel registry.

   Design: backbone is protocol-mediated (IEventBackbone). All fanout
   is via IDeliveryChannel registry — no hardcoded transport in publishers
   or subscribers."
