(ns hive-mcp.batch.ref-contract
  "The contract of the batch $ref extension seam (:bx/a - :bx/g), stated once.

   `hive-mcp.batch` reaches $ref parsing, resolution, ref collection and
   ref-dependency validation through `delegate-or-noop` extension keys, so the
   SEMANTICS live in a provider hive-mcp does not own:
   `hive-knowledge.agent.multi-batch` in production (absent from hive-mcp's
   committed deps), a port under `hive-mcp.test.stub.batch-extensions` in cold
   CI. A seam whose only specification is a docstring drifts silently; this
   namespace is the specification instead.

   What it holds:

     value objects  ParsedRef / MaybeParsedRef / Ops / ErrorStrings ... —
                    the malli shapes a provider's values must inhabit.
     judges         `parsed-ref-faithful?`, `undeclared-ref-pairs`,
                    `undeclared-ref-error` — decision procedures written
                    independently of every provider, so a provider is checked
                    against the rule rather than against another provider.
     corpora        `parse-ref-cases`, `resolve-ref-cases`,
                    `collect-ref-op-ids-cases`, `validate-ref-deps-cases` —
                    rows every provider must answer identically. The :bx/g
                    corpus carries no restated expectation at all: it is
                    derived from the judge, so a case cannot be quietly
                    re-pointed at whatever an implementation happens to do.

   Exercised by `hive-mcp.batch.ref-conformance-test`, which runs the corpora
   against every provider on the classpath."
