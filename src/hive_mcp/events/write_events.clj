(ns hive-mcp.events.write-events
  "Memory write notifications: one vocabulary for add / update / delete of a
   memory entry, published where consumers can PULL it.

   Kernel code: the vocabulary and the three sinks name no store and no memory
   slice. `hive-mcp.memory.write-events` is a call-through facade over this
   namespace and dies with the hive-memory extraction.

   A writer calls `notify!` with an op keyword and a payload; nothing here
   names a consumer. Three sinks receive the event, in this order:

     listeners               (fn [write]) registered through
                             `register-listener!`; called synchronously, so a
                             read issued after `notify!` returns observes them.
     hive-mcp.channel.core   core.async pub on :type
                             (:memory-added | :memory-updated | :memory-deleted)
     hive-events             [:memory/added | :memory/edited | :memory/deleted payload]
                             only when hive-mcp.events.core is already loaded
                             AND a handler is registered for the event id.

   The channel-type <-> hive-event mapping is owned by
   `hive-mcp.events.bridge/hook->event`; this namespace derives the hive-events
   vector from it and never restates the table.

   Payload keys (all optional): :id :memory-type :tags :project-id :fields."
