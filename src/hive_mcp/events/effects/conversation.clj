(ns hive-mcp.events.effects.conversation
  "Effect handlers for the Inter-Ling Conversation Protocol.

   These are the BOUNDARY-side translators: pure event handlers (in
   `hive-mcp.events.handlers.conversation`) emit named effects; this
   namespace executes the I/O side (NATS publish, atom-piggyback fallback,
   promise-chan delivery, registry timeout sweep).

   Stratification (decision 20260415135102-1d300fdc):
     - Action ring (boundary). Effects only translate event-handler output
       into side-effect dispatches. They never call back into the event bus.
     - Pure protocol logic + ask-id correlation lives in
       `hive-mcp.hivemind.conversation` (Calculations / Data).

   Effects registered (matching keys emitted by handlers/conversation.clj):
     - :conversation/publish-tell      — fire-and-forget delivery (NATS
                                         + per-agent inbox fallback)
     - :conversation/publish-ask       — same as tell, but the pending-ask
                                         promise-chan is registered first
     - :conversation/publish-respond   — NATS publish on the per-ask reply
                                         subject + local promise delivery
     - :conversation/register-ask      — explicit registry hook (idempotent
                                         pair with publish-ask)
     - :conversation/deliver-response  — deliver answer locally to the
                                         awaiting promise-chan
     - :conversation/inbox-push        — push envelope into the receiver's
                                         per-agent piggyback inbox
     - :conversation/timeout-ask       — defensive cleanup of stale asks

   Aliases (legacy / convenience, registered as the same handlers):
     - :conversation/deliver-tell      → :conversation/publish-tell
     - :conversation/deliver-ask       → :conversation/publish-ask
     - :conversation/deliver-respond   → :conversation/publish-respond"
