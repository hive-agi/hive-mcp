(defn dispatch
  "Dispatch an event through its registered handler chain.

   Delegates the chain to hive.events.router/dispatch-sync, which owns the ONE
   registry, builds the handler interceptor, executes the chain, runs effects
   and notifies observers. This namespace contributes only what is the host's:

   1. malli schema validation at the boundary
   2. Prometheus telemetry
   3. effect metrics and the ENGINE-L0.4 unhandled-effect counter, contributed
      as an fx executor (see `effect-executor`) rather than as a second do-fx

   Because those are contributed rather than wrapped, an addon that dispatches
   through the published hive-events library gets them too. That is what makes
   moving an addon off hive-mcp.events.core a decoupling instead of a silent
   loss of validation and telemetry.

   Registered observers (hive.events.observer) are notified after the effects
   are applied, and also for an event that has no handler.

   Throws ExceptionInfo if the event is invalid or no handler is registered.
   The router logs and returns nil for an unhandled event; this host treats
   that as an error, which is the behaviour its callers have always had."
