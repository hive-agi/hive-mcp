   The crystallize/harvest path produces a HarvestSummary whose keys

   `:created-by-type` …) do NOT match the `:decisions`/`:conventions`/…
   vocabulary the shout formatter reads — which is why the piggyback always
   read `0 decisions, 0 conventions`. This is the single producer→consumer
   projection site (see memory 20260418200155-6151635c).

   - Per-type memory-creation counts come from `:created-by-type`; unknown
     types fold into `:other` so custom types still register.
   - `:kanban-closures`, `:kg-edges`, `:memories-created` surface kanban +
     KG + total deltas.
   - Idempotent on already-consumer-shaped maps (the elisp wrap-request path
     pre-sets `:decisions`/`:conventions`/…): when `:created-by-type` is
     absent those pre-set counts pass through unchanged."

(defn- format-bucket-message
  "Format a session-wrap shout message from a stats-like map.

   Decisions and conventions always appear (count or 0). Other bucket
   types — notes, principles, axioms, snippets, plans, accomplishments,
   kanban-closures — are appended only when non-zero so the line stays
   tight on lean sessions while surfacing the full picture on rich ones.

   Disposition counters (audit kanban 20260429203442) — when producers
   populate them, the message gains a trailing \"[wrote N · merged M
   · skipped K]\" segment that disambiguates wrap-form items from the
   actual corpus delta:
     :wrapped           — entries newly written to the corpus by this wrap
     :already-in-corpus — entries deduped onto an existing record (tag merge)
     :skipped           — entries rejected (validation fail, missing fields, …)

   When ALL wrap-form bucket counts are zero AND no disposition keys are
   present, append a hint pointing the operator at /permeate so the
   classic \"0 decisions, 0 conventions\" line stops reading like
   \"nothing was learned\" — direct memory writes accrue independently.

   Accepts both `:decisions N` and `:decision-count N` shapes (legacy
   producer compat — strips trailing s and tries `<singular>-count`).
   Reason for existence: the bare 'N decisions, M conventions' format
   under-reported productive sessions where most work landed as
   conventions/principles/axioms (kanban 20260423144824)."
