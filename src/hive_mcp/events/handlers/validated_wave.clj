  "Validated wave event handlers.

   Handles events related to dispatch_validated_wave lifecycle:
   - :validated-wave/start           - Validated wave execution started
   - :validated-wave/iteration-start - Iteration within loop started
   - :validated-wave/success         - Wave completed with validation passing
   - :validated-wave/partial         - Max retries reached, partial success
   - :validated-wave/retry           - Validation failed, retrying with fix tasks

   SOLID: SRP - Validated wave lifecycle only
   CLARITY: R - Represented intent through validated-wave domain"
