  "The golden recall corpus, the fault taxonomy, and a store that can be
   deliberately broken.

   WHY THIS EXISTS
   ---------------
   The root failure of 2026-07-12 was not that recall broke. It is that recall
   broke SILENTLY: `memory search` kept returning 8 confident rows with
   plausible distances, and every agent downstream believed them. Nothing in
   the system could distinguish

       'the store holds no match for your query'          (a query outcome)

   from

       'your query encoder disagrees with your index'     (a SYSTEM FAULT)

   Both surfaced as a short, confident, wrong result list. This namespace makes
   the second one nameable, so a test can assert on it and a canary can fire.

   THE CONTRACT ENCODED HERE
   -------------------------
   An empty or anchor-less result set drawn from a POPULATED store is a system
   fault, not a query outcome. `recall-fault` returns a fault map (never throws,
   never returns a bare false) so the failing assertion PRINTS what broke.

   THE STORE HAS A BUG SWITCH
   --------------------------
   `->golden-store` takes `:emit`:

     :distance    — the post-MEM-P0-EMBED-LANE contract. Lower is nearer.
     :similarity  — the PRE-fix Milvus boundary, reproduced exactly: a COSINE
                    index reports proximity as a SIMILARITY (higher is nearer)
                    and milvus-clj carries it under the `:distance` key. The
                    store still ranks correctly internally (it knows its own
                    metric) and still returns its true top-k — only the UNIT
                    stamped on `:distance` is wrong. Downstream
                    (`chroma.search/merge-and-rerank`) then sorts ASCENDING and
                    hands back the worst of the top-k first, and the `take
                    limit` after the `limit * 2` overfetch in
                    `tools.memory.search/run-store-query` drops the best hits
                    entirely.

   That switch is the whole point: a canary that cannot be made to fail proves
   nothing. `:similarity` MUST make the suite go red."
