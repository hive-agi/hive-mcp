(ns hive-mcp.recall.canary
  "The golden recall canary: fault taxonomy + the fixture corpus it owns.

   Pure. Every fn takes OBSERVATIONS and returns a fault map or nil; nothing
   here reads a store, a config or a clock. `hive-mcp.recall.canary.live`
   supplies the observations and runs the probes.

   Fault contract. A fault fn NEVER throws and NEVER returns a bare boolean —
   nil means healthy, a map names what broke and prints as the diagnosis.

   Fixture contract. The canary owns its own anchor. Every fixture below is
   discovered by tag, not by id, and is created on first run if absent, so no
   probe can be silently disarmed by an entry someone deleted.

   Verdict contract. A probe that could not run is `:skipped` with a reason and
   is reported as such — never folded into the pass count."
