  "The runtime arm of the golden recall canary: fixtures, probes, one `run!`.

   Boundary. Every observation is read through the SAME seam an agent uses —
   `tools.memory.search/handle-search-semantic` for retrieval, the embedding
   service for widths, the carto handlers for the code index — so a canary pass
   means the caller-visible path works, not that some inner fn does.

   Contract:
   - `run!` never throws. It returns `hive-mcp.recall.canary/verdict`.
   - A probe whose provider is absent is SKIPPED with a reason and is reported;
     it never counts as a pass.
   - A fault is logged at ERROR and dispatched as :recall/canary-failed when a
     handler is registered (same opt-in shape as the grounding pass).
   - Fixtures are created once, discovered by tag thereafter, and marked
     permanent — the canary owns its anchor so no deletion can disarm it."
