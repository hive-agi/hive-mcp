  "Liveness sweep for terminal-backed lings.

   Terminal lings do not always have an OS pid in DataScript, so the pid-based
   boot sweep cannot detect closed Emacs/vterm/tmux buffers. This sweep asks the
   registered terminal strategy for status and marks confirmed-dead rows as
   :zombie + :slave/alive? false so default agent status filters hide them.

   When the terminal probe itself errors (e.g. emacsclient unreachable), we
   fall back to a `kill -0 :slave/process-pid` check. A dead pid is a strong
   dead signal even when the addon channel is degraded — without this fallback
   ghost rows accumulate forever every time Emacs restarts."

  "False BY DESIGN: `:hive/housekeeping` owns terminal liveness, not the sweep
   registry.

   This used to be a `defonce` that called `reg/register-sweep!` on load, which
   made ownership depend on WHEN the namespace happened to be required. With the
   sweep coordinator now running, that produced a real double sweep: housekeeping
   calls `sweep-once!` on its own 5 minute timer, and the registration made the
   coordinator call it again at the 60s interval this record declares. Two timers
   over the same DataScript rows make a zombification unattributable, and the
   shorter interval silently wins the cadence.

   Unregistering at coordinator start could not fix it, because the registration
   had not happened yet: housekeeping's own `resolve-and-call` is what loads this
   namespace, so the `defonce` fired AFTER the unregister and re-armed the
   duplicate. Ownership cannot be enforced by timing; the registration itself had
   to go.

   `TerminalLivenessSweep` is kept: it is a correct ISweepable and is the shape
   to use if ownership ever moves to the registry deliberately. Moving it means
   registering it somewhere explicit AND dropping the housekeeping task, in one
   change."
