(ns hive-mcp.swarm.lifecycle.boot-reconcile
  "Boot-time JVM-restart reconciliation for the swarm slave registry.

   When the hive-mcp JVM restarts, `DatahikeBootstrap` rehydrates every persisted
   slave back into the in-memory DataScript registry with its last-saved status
   (often :working / :idle). But the process that owned those agents is gone — per
   the Agent Lifecycle decision (hive memory `20260423152822-70fe5631`: `* ->
   :historical` on JVM restart), they are dead. This pass marks every rehydrated
   slave `:zombie` + `:alive? false` so they are correctly retired (and hidden from
   default `agent status`) instead of masquerading as live workers. Their rows stay
   in datahike as an append-only episodic log (vision `20260424123042-58151f4f`) —
   we reconcile, we do NOT prune (\"lifecycle over pruning\").

   Runs ONCE at boot from `server/init.clj start-swarm-sync!`, AFTER
   `swarm.sync/start-sync!` has rehydrated the registry and BEFORE the server
   accepts new spawns — so every slave present is, by definition, rehydrated from a
   prior (dead) process. Idempotent: already-dead rows are skipped, so re-runs and
   repeated boots are no-ops.

   Terminal-backed vessels (Emacs/tmux/vterm) and subprocesses with a live OS
   pid can outlive the JVM, so they are SPARED here and left to the periodic
   terminal-liveness sweep; only headless/in-JVM rows with no live backing are
   zombified. Spawn-mode + pid round-trip through `bootstrap/datahike.clj`."
