(ns hive-mcp.swarm.logic
  "Logic programming engine for swarm hivemind coordination.

   WHY CORE.LOGIC (vs DataScript)?
   ===============================
   This module uses core.logic pldb (Prolog-style in-memory database) for
   **declarative constraint queries** that would be awkward in DataScript:

   1. Transitive closure (reachability) - deadlock detection via reachable-fromo
   2. Negation-as-failure - conflict detection (file claimed by DIFFERENT slave)
   3. Batch computation - Kahn's algorithm with logical conflict grouping

   DataScript (swarm/datascript.clj) handles **entity persistence**:
   - CRUD operations on slaves, tasks, coordinators, wraps
   - Datomic-style pull queries for entity attributes
   - Transaction history and listeners

   WHEN TO USE WHICH:
   - Need to store/query entity state? → DataScript
   - Need transitive/recursive queries? → core.logic (this module)
   - Need conflict/constraint checking? → core.logic (this module)

   RELATIONS (pldb/db-rel)
   =======================
   Re-exported from logic.predicates:
   - slave:       (slave-id, status) - Worker agent state
   - task:        (task-id, slave-id, status) - Task ownership
   - claims:      (file-path, slave-id) - File ownership for conflict detection
   - depends-on:  (task-id, dep-task-id) - Task dependencies
   - task-files:  (task-id, file-path) - Files associated with task
   - edit:        (edit-id, file-path, type) - Drone wave batch planning
   - edit-depends: (edit-a, edit-b) - Edit ordering constraints

   KEY PREDICATES
   ==============
   Re-exported from logic.predicates:
   - file-conflicto:    Does another slave own this file?
   - would-deadlocko:   Would adding this dependency create a cycle?
   - reachable-fromo:   Transitive closure of dependency graph

   BATCH COMPUTATION
   =================
   compute-batches: Modified Kahn's algorithm that groups edits into
   parallel-safe batches respecting both dependencies AND file conflicts.

   THREAD SAFETY
   =============
   All mutations go through atom swap! operations. For atomic check+claim,
   use coordinator/atomic-claim-files! which locks the logic-db atom.

   DISPATCH RACE CONDITION FIX:
   This predicate prevents dispatch from proceeding while preset is loading.
   When a slave is spawned, it starts in :spawning status. The Elisp layer
   updates status to :idle when the terminal is ready and preset is loaded.
   Dispatching to a :spawning or :starting slave may result in prompts
   being lost or executed without the proper system prompt context."
