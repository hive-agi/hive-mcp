(ns hive-mcp.swarm.logic
  "Logic programming engine for swarm hivemind coordination.

   Uses core.logic pldb (Prolog-style database) to track:
   - Slave state and ownership
   - Task state and dependencies
   - File claims for conflict detection

   Provides predicates for:
   - File conflict detection
   - Circular dependency / deadlock detection
   - Dependency readiness checks"
