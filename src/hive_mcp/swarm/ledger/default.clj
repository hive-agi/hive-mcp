  "Process-wide default swarm ledger, opened lazily on first append.

   Write-through call sites resolve the store here. Opening is lazy (never at
   boot); a failure to open or append is swallowed and logged — the ledger is
   observability-grade, not transactionally coupled to the hot registry, so a
   ledger fault never breaks coordination."
