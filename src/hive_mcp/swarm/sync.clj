(ns hive-mcp.swarm.sync
  "Synchronize DataScript database with Emacs swarm state.

   Uses channel.clj event bus to receive state updates from Emacs
   and keep the DataScript database in sync for accurate conflict detection.

   Events handled:
   - :slave-spawned    - Register new slave in DataScript
   - :slave-status     - Update slave status
   - :slave-killed     - Remove slave and release claims
   - :task-dispatched  - Register task and file claims
   - :task-completed   - Mark task complete, release claims, process queue
   - :task-failed      - Mark task failed, release claims, process queue
   - :prompt-shown     - Forward permission prompts to hivemind coordinator
   - :prompt-stall     - Urgent alert when ling idle with pending prompt

   Migration Note (ADR-001):
   - Phase 1: Uses DataScript for swarm state (replacing core.logic pldb)
   - Phase 2: Elisp queries DataScript via MCP (future)
   - Phase 3: Single source of truth achieved (future)"
