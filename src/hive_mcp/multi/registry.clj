(ns hive-mcp.multi.registry
  "Façade over the four child registries (tools / verbs / aliases / batchables).

   Single SOLID-clean dispatch surface for the IAddon hooks-walk:
   `addons/core.clj` routes any `(hooks [this])` map entry whose key
   namespace is `\"multi\"` here via `register-by-key!` / `deregister-by-key!`.

   Owner = addon-id keyword (or :multi/core for boot-seeded entries).
   Per-owner ownership tagging means `deregister-by-owner!` is O(owner-keys)
   and never clobbers another addon's entries.

   Resolve chain (collapsed from 3 layers to 2):
     1. registry.tools/lookup    — covers core seed AND addon contributions
     2. flat-tool fallback        — for non-consolidated legacy tools
