(ns hive-mcp.saa.registry.tool-intents
  "neutral tool-intent keyword → tool set registry.

   One ns, one shape (SRP). Owner = addon-id keyword. Synthetic owner
   :saa/core seeds the neutral DEFAULT intents at boot.

   Unlike the singleton provider/scorer/planner registries, tool-intents
   are ACCUMULATIVE: every owner contributing to an intent unions its tools
   into that intent's set. deregister-by-owner! removes only that owner's
   slice, leaving other owners' contributions intact.

   Storage:
     :by-intent  intent-kw → {owner-kw → #{tool ...}}
     :by-owner   owner-kw  → #{intent-kw ...}")
