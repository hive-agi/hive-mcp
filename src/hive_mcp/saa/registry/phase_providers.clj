  "provider-id → IPhaseProvider registry — the SAA phase-provider dispatch source.

   One ns, one shape (SRP). Two indices per swap! to make
   deregister-by-owner! O(owner-keys).

   Owner = addon-id keyword. Synthetic owner :saa/core represents the
   DefaultPhaseProvider seeded at boot.

   Conflict policy:
     same id + same owner      → idempotent silent replace
     same id + different owner  → :saa/registry-conflict warn-log,
