(ns hive-mcp.extensions.registry
  "Opaque extension registry for optional capabilities.

   Provides a thread-safe registry where external projects can register
   implementations at startup. Consumers look up extensions by opaque
   keyword keys without knowing which project provides them.

   Usage:
     ;; Registration (at startup, by extension project)
     (register! :gs/struct-cmp my-cmp-fn)

     ;; Consumption (anywhere in hive-mcp)
     (if-let [f (get-extension :gs/struct-cmp)]
       (f node-a node-b)
       default-value)

   Thread safety: All operations are atomic via atom + swap!.
   Idempotent: Re-registering the same key replaces silently."
