  "Late addon contributions reach the advertised MCP surface without a restart.

   Composite tools are built once at boot from whatever had been contributed
   by then, and the advertised inputSchema is assembled when the server's
   tool table is (re)built. A contribution made AFTER boot — an addon mounted
   by `hot inject`, a remount from `hot reload`, a live `contribute-commands!`
   from a REPL — therefore dispatched immediately but stayed invisible: absent
   from its composite, absent from tools/list, its schema-extensions never
   re-read. This namespace subscribes to the registry's contribution events
   and does, for the one tool that changed, the three things a boot does."

   listener seam is what a contribution made DIRECTLY to
   hive-addon.registry.commands notifies, and an addon that has migrated off
   the facade makes exactly that kind of contribution. That seam was armed by a
   delay which only a facade call forced, so a fully migrated fleet would have
