  "Protocol definition for Emacs daemon lifecycle management.

   Abstracts daemon registration, heartbeat, ling binding, and
   stale detection so that different storage backends (DataScript,
   Datalevin) can be used interchangeably.

   CLARITY-L: Layers stay pure - protocol is the boundary between
   daemon domain logic and storage implementation.
   CLARITY-I: Inputs guarded at protocol boundary.

   Mirrors the coordinator pattern in:
   - hive-mcp.swarm.datascript.coordination (coordinator lifecycle)
   - hive-mcp.knowledge-graph.protocol (IGraphStore)")

(defprotocol IEmacsDaemon
  "Lifecycle management protocol for Emacs daemon instances.

   Each Emacs daemon is identified by a unique ID (typically the socket name).
   Daemons go through a lifecycle: register -> heartbeat -> terminate.
   Lings can be bound/unbound to track which agents use which daemon.

   Implementations:
   - DataScriptDaemonStore: In-memory, used by swarm coordination"

  (register! [this daemon-id opts]
    "Register a new Emacs daemon instance.

     Arguments:
       daemon-id - Unique identifier (e.g., socket name)
       opts      - Map with optional keys:
                   :socket-name - Emacs socket name (defaults to daemon-id)
                   :pid         - OS process ID
                   :emacsclient - Path to emacsclient binary

       Transaction report

     CLARITY-I: Validates daemon-id is a non-empty string.")

       daemon-id - Daemon to mark

       Transaction report or nil if daemon not found")
