(ns hive-mcp.scheduler.housekeeping
  "Periodic global housekeeping: clean up stale JVM-side resources.

   Runs on a scheduled executor (like decay.clj) every 5 minutes.
   Each cleanup task is individually guarded — one failure doesn't
   stop the sweep.

   Targets:
   - Stale callbacks (> 30 min)
   - Completed multi-async batches
   - Event journal old entries
   - Completed SAA states
   - Bounded atom GC sweep (TTL + capacity eviction)
   - Terminal liveness sweep and ledger cold sweep"

   Three outcomes, each distinguishable in the RETURNED map:
     success       -> the callee's own result
     call threw    -> fallback + {:failed true :error msg}
     unresolvable  -> {:skipped true :reason ...}

   `rescue` parks the cause in metadata, which every consumer of this map
   drops; the merge is what keeps a throwing sweep from reading as a clean one.

   The resolve is itself guarded: requiring-resolve THROWS (not nil) when the
   namespace cannot be loaded, and an unguarded throw here aborts the whole
   sweep -- every later task included."
