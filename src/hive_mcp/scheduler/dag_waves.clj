(comment
  ;; Typical usage:
  ;; 1. Coordinator creates plan and runs plan-to-kanban
  ;; 2. Start the DAG scheduler:
  (start-dag! "plan-memory-id-here"
              {:cwd "/home/lages/PP/hive/hive-mcp"
               :max-slots 5
               :presets ["ling"]})

  ;; 3. Monitor progress:
  (dag-status)

  ;; 4. Stop when done:
  (stop-dag!)

  ;; Manual completion test (simulates a ling finishing):
  (on-ling-complete {:agent-id "swarm-test-123"
                     :project-id "hive-mcp"
                     :data {:result "success"}})

  ;; Find ready tasks manually:
  (find-ready-tasks "/home/lages/PP/hive/hive-mcp" #{} {} #{}))
