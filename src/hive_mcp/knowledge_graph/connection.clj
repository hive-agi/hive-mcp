;; Leverages Queue concurrency primitive (Grokking Simplicity Ch 15):
;; Individual transact! calls are coalesced into batched writes.
;;
;; Design: core.async channel + go-loop consumer.
;; - Producers put individual tx-data vectors onto the channel.
;; - Consumer drains all available items within a 25ms window,
;;   then flushes them as a single d/transact! call.
;; - d/transact! (async) provides a second layer of auto-batching
;;   at the Datahike level (per whilo's advice: memory 20260205231755).
;;
;; This eliminates the "Transacting 1 objects" pattern that causes
;; high CPU on sequential single-entity writes.

;; in-flight: count of items enqueued on tx-chan but not yet flushed.
;; Incremented by transact! on successful put!, decremented by flush-batch!
;; after proto/transact! completes. Used by flush-pending! to detect drain.
