(ns hive-mcp.knowledge-graph.queries
  "Graph queries for Knowledge Graph traversal and analysis.

   Provides traversal algorithms and analytical queries over the KG:
   - traverse: Walk graph from starting node (BFS)
   - find-path: Find shortest path between nodes
   - impact-analysis: Find all dependents of a node
   - subgraph: Extract subgraph visible from a scope
   - find-contradictions: Locate conflicting knowledge
   - get-node-context: Full context for node display

   SOLID-S: Single Responsibility - graph query operations only.
   SOLID-O: Open/Closed - new query types via new functions.
   CLARITY-A: Architectural performance via bounded depth.
   CLARITY-I: Inputs guarded - validates parameters."
