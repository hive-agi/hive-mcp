   Order matters, and both steps are load-bearing:

   1. Close tx-chan FIRST. A closed channel still yields its buffered items
      before yielding nil, so the loop drains the backlog and then exits.
      Closing ctrl-chan first (the previous behaviour) let the loop's `alts!`
      pick the control port while tx-chan still held items, silently dropping
      queued edges.

   2. Join the loop before returning. The loop may be parked inside
      flush-batch! -> proto/transact! -> LMDB. Callers stop the writer and then
      close the store and delete its files (see the KG store test harness), so
      returning early frees an env and unmaps files underneath a live
      transaction. LMDB does not throw for that — it walks a dangling page
      pointer and takes the whole JVM down with SIGSEGV in
      mdb_page_search_root. `stop` has to mean stopped, not asked-to-stop."
