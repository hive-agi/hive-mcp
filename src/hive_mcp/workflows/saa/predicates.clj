  "Dispatch predicates and FSM interceptors for the SAA workflow.

   All predicates are pure functions of state data — no side effects.
   Used by the FSM spec (both inline and EDN) to determine state transitions.

   Also contains FSM pre/post interceptors for trace logging and
   no-op subscription handlers.

   DDD: Value Objects — pure data predicates, no domain logic."
