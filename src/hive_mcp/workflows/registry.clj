(ns hive-mcp.workflows.registry
  "EDN workflow registry — load FSM specs from resources/fsm/*.edn at boot.

   The registry manages the lifecycle of data-driven FSM workflows:
   1. Scan:     Read .edn spec files from resources/fsm/
   2. Register: Associate handler-maps with workflow names
   3. Compile:  Compile specs with handlers via (fsm/compile spec handler-map)
   4. Lookup:   Retrieve compiled FSMs by name for execution

   ## Design

   EDN specs use keyword handlers (e.g., :start, :smite) that are resolved
   to actual functions at compile time via the handler-map. This separates
   the workflow topology (data) from the implementation (code).

   ## Usage

   ```clojure
   (require '[hive-mcp.workflows.registry :as wf-reg])

   ;; At boot
   (wf-reg/init!)

   ;; At runtime
   (when-let [wf (wf-reg/get-workflow :forge-belt)]
     (fsm/run wf resources initial-state))

   ;; Dev hot-reload
   (wf-reg/reload!)
   ```"

(defn- compile-opts-fns
  "Resolve every spec reference `fsm/compile` does NOT resolve itself.

   fsm/compile resolves state `:handler` keywords from the handler-map and
   SCI-compiles `(fn ...)` dispatch predicates. It leaves untouched:
   - dispatch predicates written as keywords
   - :opts :subscriptions {path {:handler ...}}
   - :opts :pre / :opts :post hooks

   Here `(fn ...)` list forms are SCI-compiled and keywords are looked up in
   REF-MAP. Values already functions — and keywords absent from REF-MAP —
   pass through unchanged.

   A dispatch predicate is additionally resolved through `dh/current` to an
   actual FUNCTION. `fsm/compile-state-handler` spells its gate `(if (fn? pred)
   pred (sci/eval-form sci-ctx pred))`, so a var-held predicate is not passed
   through but handed to SCI as though it were an unevaluated form. This is
   the second of the two places a var must not survive; the other is
   `saa-workflow/resolve-dispatches`, and both exist because REF-MAP entries
   may now be vars.

   Handlers, `:pre`, `:post` and subscription handlers are deliberately left
   alone: `fsm/run` invokes each directly, a var is IFn, and keeping the var
   means a reload reaches them at invocation rather than at compile."
