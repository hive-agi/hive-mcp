  "Shared boundary/interceptor primitives for the workflow FSM subsystem.

  Owns the try/catch/log envelope duplication that had accreted across the SAA,
  wrap-session, complete-session and catchup-session FSM handlers plus the
  spawn dispatch sites:

    IDegradePolicy  — the ONE strategy seam distinguishing a FATAL caught
                      throwable (stamp a top-level :error, route to ::fsm/error)
                      from a DEGRADE-CONTINUE one (merge a per-site delta, no
                      fatal :error). Two zero-field records + two singletons;
                      policy = nil is the third (hard-propagate, no catch) mode.
    boundary-step   — the invariant guard -> try effect -> success | throw ->
                      policy | absent envelope.
    now-str         — the single injectable-clock seam (:clock-fn resources).
    trace-log-enter/exit — clock-injected :pre/:post trace interceptors.
    shout!          — the rescue-guarded always-fires non-critical hook.
    always          — the trivial dispatch predicate.
    default-handle-error — factory for the wrap+complete terminal throw.
    resolve-session-identity — the agent-id/directory/project-id triad.
    handle-evict    — the shared evict boundary step (fatal vs degrade by arg).
    mark-task-inprogress! / mark-tasks-inprogress! — kanban in-progress marker
                      with the store (update-fn) INJECTED so support stays
                      strictly below the tools stratum.

  LAYERING: depends only on taoensso.timbre + hive-mcp.dns.result. Every seam
  handed to fsm/compile stays a bare var/fn (records live only inside
  boundary-step's catch), so keyword-resolvability is preserved. Handlers stay
  (resources data) -> data' (terminals (resources fsm) -> result); this ns is
  called FROM WITHIN handler bodies."
