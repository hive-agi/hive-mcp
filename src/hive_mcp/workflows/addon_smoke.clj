(ns hive-mcp.workflows.addon-smoke
  "Boot smoke-check for the hive-workflows library addons.

   Verifies — against the LIVE classpath — that the two hive-workflows addons
   are discovered via their META-INF/hive-addons manifests and initialize their
   method-dispatch strategies into the hive-mcp registries:

     - hive.workflows.strategy  -> :method strategies (dag-wave/saa/forge-belt)
     - hive.workflows.progress  -> :progress websocket + transcript wiring

   WHY a REPL check and not a cold deftest: hive-workflows is wired into the
   server ONLY via local.deps.edn (:local/root \"../hive-workflows\"); it is
   absent from deps.edn and every :test* alias. A cold `clojure -M:test` JVM
   therefore has NO workflow addon on its classpath, so the manifest scan finds
   nothing and a plain assertion would false-fail. This check must run in a JVM
   launched with the local/live classpath — i.e. the running server (7910).
   Run `(check)` there; see the (comment) runbook at the bottom.
