(ns hive-mcp.batch
  "Pure batch-runner for cross-tool operations. Extracted from
   `hive-mcp.tools.multi` (T13 Phase 1) so that:

   - The runner is a bounded context with zero tool-specific knowledge.
   - `hive-mcp.tools.multi` becomes a thin hive-mcp-flavored wrapper that
     supplies handler resolution + FX emission.
   - Downstream (T13 Phase 2) a `Batchable` protocol will wrap this runner
     so any consolidated tool can opt into batch/dsl/collect semantics.

   This namespace owns:
   - Operation normalization (string->keyword keys, id auto-gen, deps coercion)
   - Validation pipeline (required fields, unique ids, dep references, cycles, ref-deps)
   - Wave assignment (delegated to extension :bx/i)
   - $ref resolution (delegates :bx/a–:bx/g)
   - Single-op execution with error isolation (handler injected)
   - Wave execution (delegates :bx/j)
   - Top-level `run-operations` orchestrator

   Zero behavior change versus pre-extraction `tools.multi/run-multi`.
   Extension hooks (:bx/*) are preserved verbatim."
