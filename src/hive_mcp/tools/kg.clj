  "MCP tool handlers for Knowledge Graph operations.

   Provides MCP tools for:
   - kg_add_edge: Create relationship between nodes
   - kg_traverse: Walk graph from starting node
   - kg_impact_analysis: Find dependents before modification
   - kg_promote: Bubble knowledge up scope hierarchy
   - kg_find_path: Find shortest path between nodes
   - kg_subgraph: Extract visible subgraph for a scope
   - kg_contradictions: Find conflicting knowledge
   - kg_node_context: Get full context for a node
   - kg_reground: Re-verify entry against source, detect drift

   SOLID-S: Single Responsibility - MCP tool handlers only.
   CLARITY-I: Inputs validated at tool boundary.
   CLARITY-Y: Graceful error handling."
