  "MCP handlers for kanban tasks. Pure orchestration delegates to:

   - hive-mcp.tools.kanban.predicates  — status enums + entry shape
   - hive-mcp.tools.kanban.transitions — pure derivation of new state
   - hive-mcp.tools.kanban.events      — event-driven move semantics

   Status transitions are SOFT: moving to `done` retags the entry as
   `done` (status field + tag) and stamps `:completed`, but the memory
   entry id and KG edges are preserved.

   Hard delete remains available via the explicit `delete*` path for
   duplicates / cancellations."
