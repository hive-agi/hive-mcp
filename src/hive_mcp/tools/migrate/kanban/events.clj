  "Hive-events surface for the kanban migrator. The migrator's use-cases
   stay railway-oriented and synchronous; events are an observation
   side-channel (logging, telemetry, optional UI feeds) — not the control
   flow.

   Event ids are namespaced under `:kanban-mig/...` so subscribers can
   filter cleanly. Default handlers just log via timbre; downstream
   layers can override via `reg-event-fx` or hook fx by name."
