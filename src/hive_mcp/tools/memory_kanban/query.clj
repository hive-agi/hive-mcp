(defn query-kanban-entries
  "Fetch kanban entries from the underlying memory store.

   Routes via `kanban-facade` so reads honor the `:memory/kanban-store`
   config toggle: `:default` keeps milvus behavior, `:dual-read` merges
   :kanban + :default with kanban-first preference, `:kanban` reads
   only the dedicated qdrant collection.

   `query-tags` are pushed into the store query (server-side AND-filter)
   and `limit` is the store window the caller planned; nothing here widens
   or narrows it. Callers size it with `plan/whole-board`.

   Scope resolution honours the SAME inheritance the rest of the memory
   system uses (knowledge_graph/scope.clj): a list sees its own scope +
   ANCESTORS (UP, always on), plus DESCENDANTS (DOWN) when
   `include-descendants?` is set. See `resolve-visible-project-ids`.

   `opts` (optional) :scope \"all\" lifts the project filter entirely and
   returns the whole board across every workspace."
