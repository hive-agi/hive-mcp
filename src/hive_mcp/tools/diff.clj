(ns hive-mcp.tools.diff
  "Diff-based workflow tools for drone agents.
   
   Drones (OpenRouter free-tier models) cannot safely use file_write/file_edit
   directly due to their lower capability. This module provides a review-based
   workflow where drones propose diffs that the hivemind can review and apply.
   
   Workflow:
   1. Drone calls propose_diff with old/new content and description
   2. Hivemind reviews with list_proposed_diffs (sees unified diff)
   3. Hivemind calls apply_diff (applies change) or reject_diff (discards)
   
   Architecture (DDD/SOLID):
   - Domain: Diff lifecycle (pending → applied/rejected)
   - Application: Handlers coordinate validation + state updates
   - Infra: File I/O via slurp/spit (mocked in tests)"
