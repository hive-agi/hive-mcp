   durable BEFORE the tool call returns — read-your-writes at the tool boundary.
   The immediate beneficiary is the multi/k> DSL: a later op that traverses or
   reads the just-created edge must not race the ~25ms coalescing window.

   conn/flush-pending! is a cheap no-op when the queue is empty (returns :ok
   without blocking), so wrapping the validation/error paths costs nothing.

   Centralizes a policy that was previously inlined in handle-kg-add-edge alone
   — the gap that let kg_promote return before its edge was durable. NOT applied
   to handlers that write the *memory* store (kg_reground, kg_backfill_grounding
   via mem-proto): flush-pending! drains only the KG writer. kg_cleanup_synthetics
   drains internally. Kanban 20260629161156-76f4e486."
