   :description "Consolidated memory operations. Commands: add, query, metadata, get, search, duration, promote, demote, log_access, feedback, helpfulness, tags, cleanup, expiring, expire, migrate, migrate-scoped, import, decay, xpoll, rename, edit, review, reembed, batch-add, batch-edit, batch-feedback, batch-get, batch-reembed. Use 'query' only for structured filters (type/tags/scope/duration); use 'search' for natural-language semantic retrieval. Use 'help' command to list all.\n\nAxiom gate: `type: \"axiom\"` is NOT written directly — it is a NOMINATION. The entry is parked as type `axiom-candidate`, tagged `axiom-pending`, and listed for human review at the next catchup; the add response carries `queued_for_review`. Nominate freely, but write the entry so a reviewer can judge it: state the invariant and why breaking it is a category error rather than a footgun. Only a human resolves it, via 'review'.\n\nReview: 'review' with NO id lists the pending queue. 'review' with id + verdict=\"approve\" lands the originally requested type (axiom); verdict=\"reject\" lands `as` (default principle). Both strip the pending tags and stamp an audit trail. Reviewing is a human decision — do not call approve on your own nomination unless the user asked you to.\n\nEdit: 'edit' mutates an entry in place (id preserved → KG edges preserved). Params: id (required), type, content, find+replace, tags, duration, abstraction_level, reason. find+replace (exclusive with content) swaps the one exact occurrence of find in the content; zero or several occurrences is an error. Any other param is rejected with an error, never ignored. Content change triggers re-embed. 'batch-edit' takes operations:[...] and optional dry-run:true for validation preview.\n\nReembed: 'reembed' re-vectorizes an entry without rewriting content (id required). Use after embedding-model swaps, vector-index rebuilds, or stale-vector recovery. Preserves id, content, tags, edges, duration, abstraction-level, project-id. 'batch-reembed' takes ids:[...] for sequential per-op processing.\n\nWrites default to async: they return {:queued true :task-id ...} immediately and deliver the real result via ---TOOLRESULT--- on the caller's next tool call. Pass async:false to force sync. Reads (query/metadata/get/search/expiring/batch-get) stay synchronous by default; pass async:true to queue them."

(defn tool-defs
  "Advertisement-time tool-defs for the memory supertool.

   A FN, not a def: the `relation` enum is registry-backed
   (hive-mcp.knowledge-graph.schema/relation-types) and addons register their
   relation types during initialize!, AFTER this namespace loads. A static enum
   freezes at ns-load and drifts from the set the store actually accepts — that
   is how the core `:relates` relation became a dead capability (advertised
   nowhere, therefore never chosen). Resolving here (registry/get-base-tools
   runs per tools/list, post-init) keeps the advertised enum a faithful mirror.

   Also advertises `predicate`, the free-text lane of the OPEN `:relates`
   relation. Falls back to the static `tool-def` (core enum) if the KG schema
   ns is unresolvable (KG addon absent).

   Folds in the advertised params of every subdomain `canonical-handlers`
   delegates to (kg, migration), so a subdomain param survives the MCP
   boundary instead of being dropped and silently defaulted. Memory's own
   declarations win on conflict.

   requiring-resolve, not a static :require — memory.clj lazily resolves the KG
   namespace by design (DIP; see canonical-handlers)."
