(ns hive-mcp.tools.consolidated.hot
  "Consolidated `hot` tool — hot-reload of mounted IAddon instances.

   `hive hot reload <addon-id>` rebuilds one addon from its mount manifest and
   cascades to every addon that was handed its instance at mount time. The work
   itself lives in hive-addon.hot; this namespace is only the MCP edge:
   resolve which addons are actually mounted, drive the bridge, render a report.

   hive-addon.hot is resolved SOFTLY. hive-mcp pins hive-addon by version, and
   the bridge lands in a later release than the pin — a hard `:require` would
   make this namespace fail to compile against the pinned jar. Until the pin is
   bumped every command answers with an actionable :unavailable message instead
   of breaking the tool surface.

   Only addons that are CURRENTLY REGISTERED in the host are reloadable. The
   classpath manifests are the superset; the composer's plug layers may have
   deliberately dropped some of them, and remounting a dropped addon from its raw
   manifest would resurrect something the system chose not to run.

   hive-hot is the namespace-level engine. It MUST be initialized with the addon
   source dirs this system actually derived (`:hot/dirs`) and with the protocol
   interlock (`:no-reload`) — see `ensure-hot-init!` for why letting it
   self-initialize is a bug, not a convenience."

   Without this, the first reload calls `hive-hot.core/reload!` on an

   `{:dirs [\"src\"]}` — resolved against the SERVER's working directory, not the
   addon repos. clj-reload then watches the wrong tree: it can neither see the
   addon sources that actually changed nor protect the protocol namespaces, and
   every subsequent reload reports success while reloading nothing relevant.

   The dirs come from `hive-addon.hot/plan`, which derives them from where each
   addon's constructor namespace physically resolves — so only `:local/root`
   addons contribute, which is exactly the set whose bytes can change.
   `:no-reload` carries the protocol interlock. `:since` is the JVM start time:
   an edit made after boot but before the first `hot` call is a change, not
   the baseline (hive-hot >= 0.1.9 honours it; older versions ignore it).

   With hive-hot's `ensure-init!` (>= 0.1.9) an already-initialized registry is
   EXTENDED with any new dirs instead of reset, so a `hot inject` adds its
   source root without discarding pending changes.
