   running a STRIKE: its two non-test callers are both on the strike path. So
   the only way to ask 'what would this plan do' was to make it do it, and every
   attempt to verify plan scoping read-only came back looking like a deployment
   gap because `forge survey` fell through :_handler to the belt dashboard and
   answered with global kanban totals instead.

   Contract: forge-ops/survey returns a plain selection map; it is shaped by
   forge-ops/survey-view (each task's routing, no card bodies) and wrapped in
   result/ok before the bridge; a successful survey is a non-error JSON payload,
   a thrown survey is an MCP error naming the failure.
