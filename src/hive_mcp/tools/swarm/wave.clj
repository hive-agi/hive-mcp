(ns hive-mcp.tools.swarm.wave
  "Wave execution for batch drone dispatch.

   Executes multiple drone tasks in parallel with bounded concurrency.
   Integrates with DataScript for state tracking and hive-events for
   lifecycle events.

   Usage:
   1. Create plan with tasks
   2. Execute wave (async, bounded concurrency)
   3. Monitor via events or get-wave-status

   SOLID: SRP - Wave orchestration only
   CLARITY: A - Architectural performance via bounded concurrency"
