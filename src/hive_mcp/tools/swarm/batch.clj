(ns hive-mcp.tools.swarm.batch
  "Wave 3 / T13 Phase 3 — Batchable runner for the consolidated `swarm` tool.

   Swarm's `canonical-handlers` is a *nested* tree keyed by subdomain
   (`:agent`, `:wave`, `:hivemind`, `:agora`, `:olympus`). The contract
   runner receives each op's `:tool` string and must map it to a single
   handler fn; we walk the tree using `hive-mcp.tools.cli/resolve-handler`
   so callers can say `\"agent spawn\"`, `\"hivemind.shout\"`, etc.

   Swarm MIGHT justify `DAGBatchable`/`StreamingBatchable` later (it is
   the only Wave-3 tool with wave-style semantics of its own), but per
   the track-B scope we implement only `Batchable` and defer the richer
   contracts. The delegate is the `DefaultBatchRunner`, which itself
   already satisfies `DAGBatchable` and `StreamingBatchable` — so callers
   who need those can reach through to the delegate.

   The consolidated swarm ns is resolved lazily via `requiring-resolve`
   so this batch ns loads even if e.g. agent-sdk / hivemind deps are
   unavailable. Contract tests bind their own resolver anyway.

   Purely additive — `handle-swarm` / `tool-def` are untouched."
