   Cross-slot routing: a `:default` (milvus) entry that depends-on a
   target living in `:kanban` (qdrant-local) needs its back-edge
   metadata write routed to the qdrant slot. Probing the registry
   resolves the target's actual slot regardless of which slot the
   source entry was written to.

   :default is probed first when present so the common case (axioms,

   :default entry to a target living in :kanban (or vice-versa) would
   read+write the wrong slot — the read returns nil, the write is a
   silent no-op, and the kg-incoming bookkeeping drifts.

   Uses the IMemoryStoreMetadataWrite protocol (`update-metadata!`)
   when the resolved store satisfies it — the no-embed fast path. Falls
   back to the slow `update-entry!` for stores that don't implement
   metadata writes (re-embeds on every field change).

  "Inner core of handle-add. Runs the memory-store/KG IO path through
   the IMemoryStore registered under `:store-key` (default `:default`).

   `:store-key` propagates to dedup find/update, primary index, and
   finalize. Kanban callers thread `:kanban` (or `:dual-read`-resolved)
   to land in the dedicated qdrant collection without disturbing the
   generic memory-add surface used by axiom/principle/snippet writes.

   Both the duplicate-detection read and the duplicate-tag-merge write
   are wrapped in `with-resilience`: if the Milvus HTTP transport drops
   between the find-duplicate call and the dedup update, the heal loop
   fires and the call retries once — otherwise transient failures here
   would leak through `with-store`'s generic try/catch as errors."
