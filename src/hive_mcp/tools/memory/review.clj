  "Human review queue for write-gated memory types.

   A write requesting a gated type (see type-registry :gate) is parked as the
   gate's queue type and tagged pending. This namespace is the ONLY authority
   that resolves such an entry: approve lands the originally requested type,
   reject lands a different one. Both strip the pending residue, so a resolved
   entry never looks queued again.

   Resolution delegates to the ordinary edit path with the gate bypassed, so
   there is exactly one implementation of 'update an entry in place' and the
   entry id — hence every KG edge keyed by it — survives untouched."
