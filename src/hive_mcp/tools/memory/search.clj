  "Semantic search handler for memory operations.

   Defensive timeout architecture (task 20260404125344-0365f8a8):
   Production hangs were observed from three failure modes —
   Milvus HTTP 'selector manager closed' (dead grpc client after OOM),
   Qdrant grpc 'INTERNAL: Panic!', and unreachable embedding providers.
   Each could leave a bare @future blocked indefinitely, starving the
   MCP handler pool and killing stdio.

   Defense in depth with structured surfacing:
   - Per-stage timeouts: vectordb (15s), post-filter/format (5s).
     Embedding is nested inside the store's search-similar; its budget
     is covered by the vectordb stage and surfaced via ex-classification
     (exceptions containing 'embed' in the message map to :stage :embed).
   - fork-join with a 30s collective budget runs the store and ingest
     queries concurrently, each with its own fallback. A failure on
     one side still yields a partial response.
   - Outer wpool/await! on memory-pool remains the hard ceiling.

   On timeout or throw, we return a Result err:
     {:error :memory/search-failed
      :stage :embed|:vectordb|:post
      :partial <whatever completed>
      :cause <ex-message>}

   Happy-path overhead: one safe-future-call allocation per stage
   (<1ms); the fork-join deadline check is O(tasks). Callers see no
   shape change on success — only a structured err body on failure."
