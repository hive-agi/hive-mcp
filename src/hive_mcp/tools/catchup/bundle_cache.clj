(ns hive-mcp.tools.catchup.bundle-cache
  "Process-wide cache for the per-project catchup bundle.

   Two tiers, both in memory and shared by every session on this JVM:

     bundle   project-id -> {:value bundle :stored-at ms :store-ref ref}
              `cached-bundle` serves a fresh entry as is, serves a stale one
              while a background refresh runs, and computes a cold one under
              single-flight so concurrent callers for the same project share
              one computation.
     content  entry-id -> {:value entry :stored-at ms :store-ref ref}
              `cached-entries` hands hydration the entries it already holds
              and fetches only the missing ids.

   An entry is only served for the store instance it was computed against
   (`:store-ref`, a weak reference): a swapped :default store starts cold.

   Invalidation is PULLED from `hive-mcp.memory.write-events`: the cache
   registers `invalidate!` as a synchronous listener, so a write of a
   bundle-relevant type drops every bundle before `notify!` returns, and an
   update or a delete also evicts that id from the content tier.
   `fresh-ttl-ms` and `max-age-ms` remain the safety net for writes that
   never pass through the notifier (another JVM, a direct backend edit).

   A bundle whose buckets are all empty is returned but never stored.
   `now-ms` is the clock; tests pin it with with-redefs."
