(ns hive-mcp.plan.tool
  "MCP tool for converting plan memory entries to kanban tasks with KG edges.

   Implements the exploration-to-kanban pipeline:
   1. Fetch plan from memory by ID
   2. Parse plan steps using plan.parser (EDN or markdown)
   3. Create kanban tasks via memory system
   4. Create KG edges: plan --depends-on--> tasks
   5. Create KG edges: task --depends-on--> task (from step dependencies)"
