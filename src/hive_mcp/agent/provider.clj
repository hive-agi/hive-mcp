  "Provider PIPELINE stratum: collect, then promote, and nothing else.

   This is the single seam every caller asks \"which providers exist, which can
   I call, and which one answers this request\". It performs no I/O of its own:
   it calls collectors (`hive-mcp.agent.provider.collect`) and hands what they
   return to pure decisions (`hive-mcp.agent.provider.policy`).

   Adding, removing or reordering a provider is therefore a CONFIG edit:
     hive config set llm-providers.acme.api-url https://acme.test/v1/chat/completions
     hive config set llm-providers.venice false        ;; take one out
     hive config set llm-provider-priority [:acme :ollama-compat]

   The boundary that speaks HTTP lives in `hive-mcp.agent.openrouter`, which
   consumes this namespace and re-exports its surface for back-compat."
