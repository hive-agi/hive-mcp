  "Drone feedback loop - learn from execution results.

   CLARITY-T (Telemetry First): Records execution patterns for analysis.
   CLARITY-Y (Yield Safe Failure): Routes away from failing model/task combos.

   This module:
   1. Classifies drone execution results
   2. Records patterns to project memory (Chroma)
   3. Queries patterns before dispatch for smart routing
   4. Aggregates weekly statistics for pattern analysis

   Extracted for 200 LOC compliance and single responsibility."
