(ns hive-mcp.agent.drone.decompose
  "Task decomposition for drone delegation.

   Large tasks overwhelm free-tier models. This module provides:
   - Complexity estimation based on file size, task length, operation count
   - Decomposition strategies (by-function, by-section, by-operation)
   - Auto-decomposition for delegate_drone

   SOLID: SRP - Single responsibility for task decomposition
   CLARITY: I - Inputs validated, complexity estimated before dispatch"
