(defn delegate!

   - Uses drone-worker preset for OpenRouter
   - Auto-applies any diffs proposed by the drone
   - Records results to hivemind for review
   - Reports status to parent ling (if parent-id provided) for swarm state sync
   - Releases file locks on completion (even on error)

   Options:
     :task      - Task description (required)
     :files     - List of files the drone will modify (contents pre-injected)
     :preset    - Override preset (default: drone-worker)
