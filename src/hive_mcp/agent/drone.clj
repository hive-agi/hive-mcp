  "Drone delegation - token-optimized leaf agents.

   Drones are lightweight agents that:
   - Use OpenRouter free-tier models
   - Pre-inject file contents (no read tool calls needed)
   - Use propose_diff instead of direct file writes
   - Auto-apply proposed diffs on completion
   - Report status to parent lings for swarm sync
   - Receive smart context injection (imports, lint, conventions)"

(defn delegate!
  "Delegate a task to a drone (token-optimized leaf agent).

   Automatically:
   - Acquires file locks via coordinator (conflict prevention)
   - Pre-injects file contents (drone doesn't need to read)
   - Injects catchup context (conventions, decisions, snippets)
   - Creates sandbox enforcing file scope (CLARITY-I)
   - Uses drone-worker preset for OpenRouter
   - Auto-applies any diffs proposed by the drone (unless :skip-auto-apply)
   - Records results to hivemind for review
   - Reports status to parent ling (if parent-id provided) for swarm state sync
   - Releases file locks on completion (even on error)

   Options:
     :task           - Task description (required)
     :files          - List of files the drone will modify (contents pre-injected)
     :task-type      - Explicit task type (:testing, :refactoring, :bugfix, :documentation, :general)
                       If nil, auto-inferred from task description
     :preset         - Override preset (default: auto-selected based on task-type)
     :trace          - Enable progress events (default: true)
     :parent-id      - Parent ling's slave-id (for swarm status sync)
     :cwd            - Working directory override for path resolution
     :skip-auto-apply - When true, don't auto-apply diffs (for validated wave mode)
     :wave-id        - Wave ID to tag proposed diffs for batch review

   Tool Minimization:
     Drones receive minimal tools based on task-type:
     - :testing       - read_file, kondo_lint, cider_eval_silent
     - :refactoring   - read_file, grep, glob_files, kondo_lint, kondo_analyze
     - :bugfix        - read_file, kondo_lint, magit_diff
     - :documentation - read_file (most restrictive)
     - :general       - read_file, kondo_lint (default)

   Returns result map with :status, :result, :agent-id, :files-modified, :proposed-diff-ids

   Sandbox enforcement:
     - Drones can only read/write files in their :files list
     - Blocked: bash, memory writes, agent spawning
     - Blocked patterns: .env, credentials, secrets, keys

   Throws ex-info if file conflicts detected (files locked by another drone)."

(defn delegate-with-retry!
  "Delegate a task to a drone with automatic retry on transient failures.

   Wraps delegate! with exponential backoff retry logic:
   - Rate limits: Wait longer + retry with alternative model
   - Timeouts: Retry with backoff
   - Model errors: Try fallback model (coding -> coding-alt -> docs)
   - Auth errors: Fail fast (permanent error)

   Options (in addition to delegate! options):
     :max-retries       - Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
     :initial-delay-ms  - Initial backoff delay (default: 1000)
     :max-delay-ms      - Maximum backoff delay (default: 30000)
     :on-retry          - Callback fn [attempt ex strategy] called on each retry

   Returns:
     Same as delegate!, with additional :retry-info map:
       :retries      - Number of retries performed
       :models-tried - List of models attempted
       :total-duration-ms - Total time including retries

   CLARITY-Y: Graceful degradation through smart retries.
   CLARITY-T: All retries are logged for observability.

   Example:
     (delegate-with-retry!
